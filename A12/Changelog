Alpha Version 12

Updated Hub World
    Added path from door to well.

Worlds folder has been moved into assets
    
Error 101 is now part of error 100
    this change is due to the worlds folder being moved to part of the assets folder

Added world version checking
    checks to make sure the the world being loaded is compatable with the current version, if not error 103 is triggered, and allows you to update the manifest file of the world to match current version if you are sure that it is compatable. otherwise you can return to where you were, or quit to desktop
    
    
Alpha Version 11

Minor Refactoring
    Refactored the code a bit, doesnt change much from gameplay perspective

Added Debug world
    Nothing really interesting, just a world that has all possible tiles, might make it autogenerated later, for now it is its own world

    Currently does nothing yet, just a placeholder as is the level and points values.
    

Alpha Version 10

Removed legacy map editor controls
    You can no longer hold "i" and press number keys to place tiles, this has been replaced by the new map editor mode
    
Added New Map Editor mode
    Map editor mode allows you to easily place tiles in the world use the number keys to place tiles, hold shift and press the number to cycle the tile it places, organized in 
        1: ground tiles
        2: decorative tiles
        3: container tiles
        4: roof tiles
        5: wall tiles
        6: door tiles
        
Added /update command
    this command allows you to update a map that you are editing without any text promps, this also does not touch the world manifest file. this function will also be used to save anything youve done in an area of the game when you leave, such as opened chests, killed entities, etc.

Removed Placeholder Titlescreen
    CDF-Quest will now default load "Hub" world. if this world does not exist, it will throw an error and, if you continue, will take you to a blank world with default values. use /gamemode and choose 1 to enter map editor mode
    
    
Alpha Version 9

Added Protected World password
    This prevents worlds from being accidentally overwriten if you do not provide the protection password that is matched in the manifest file, this is not a security feature and is easily bypassed, it exists soley to prevent saving to the wrong world on accident.

Added file extention to world files
    There was no issue with the game and no extentions, however when viewed in a file browser, the extentionless files could act strange, so ive added the cdf extention to both the manifest file, and the map files, this extention is contextual, as what is in the file and what it does is based on where its at in the folder structure and its title.
